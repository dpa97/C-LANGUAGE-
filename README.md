 Task 1 â€“ File Handling Program
The first task aimed to introduce fundamental file handling operations using the C programming language. In this task, I created a program that can:

Create a text file

Write user input to the file

Read contents from the file

Append new data to an existing file

The file was manipulated using standard functions like fopen(), fwrite(), fscanf(), fputs(), and fgets(). This task provided a strong foundation in persistent data storage, a concept crucial in applications like databases and log management. The program was tested using input.txt and output.txt files within VS Code, and the output validated proper file reading and writing operations.

ðŸ”¹ Task 2 â€“ Linked List Implementation
This task involved the implementation of a Singly Linked List, a dynamic data structure that allows insertion and deletion of elements without the need to shift memory locations. The operations implemented were:

Insertion at the beginning and end

Deletion by value or from beginning/end

Traversal and display of the list

Through this task, I gained practical exposure to dynamic memory allocation using malloc() and effective pointer manipulation. This task sharpened my understanding of data structures and helped in visualizing how operating systems and compilers manage memory using linked structures.

ðŸ”¹ Task 3 â€“ Compiler Design Basics (Lexical Analyzer)
In this task, I designed a simple lexical analyzer in C. This tool scans a source code text file (input.txt) and identifies:

Keywords (e.g., int, if, return)

Operators (+, -, =, etc.)

Identifiers (variable names)

This task gave me a fundamental understanding of the first phase of a compiler â€“ lexical analysis. The program reads character-by-character, builds tokens, and classifies them. It mimics how a compiler breaks source code into tokens before parsing. I learned how pattern recognition and file scanning work in real-world compilers. This task was greatly supported through documentation and sample patterns referenced from ChatGPT and GeeksforGeeks.

ðŸ”¹ Task 4 â€“ Data Compression Tool (Run-Length Encoding â€“ RLE)
This task focused on designing a basic data compression and decompression tool using the Run-Length Encoding (RLE) technique. The program:

Compresses repeating characters in a text file (e.g., aaaab â†’ a4b1)

Decompresses the compressed data back to the original format

The tool was interactive and file-driven, handling input.txt, compressed.txt, and decompressed.txt. This introduced the concept of lossless data compression and showed how encoding schemes reduce file size without data loss. The concept is foundational for understanding image compression, archives, and data transmission.
